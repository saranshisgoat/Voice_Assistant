Usage
Run the main() function to initiate the voice assistant.
Use voice commands prefixed with the keyword "siri" for the assistant to recognize.
Example Commands:
"smj, add a task": Adds a task to the list.
"smj, list tasks": Lists the current tasks.
"smj, take a screenshot": Captures a screenshot.
"smj, open chrome": Opens Chrome to a specific URL.
"smj, exit": Terminates the voice assistant.
Notes
Ensure paths to Python, the main script, and FFmpeg are correctly specified.
Handle KeyboardInterrupt (Ctrl+C) to exit the program gracefully.
